[TOC]

If spilling soda, spaghetti sauce, or orange juice on themselves strikes your students with the fear of wearing dirty clothes among their peers, Nano-Tex, LLC, would encourage them to shop for pants and shirts made with NANO-CARE® fabric - pants and shirts that almost magically resist stains and repel water, giving us the ability to walk away from messy situations with clean clothes. Nano-Tex supplies material to many well-known brands (Nano-Tex). What looks like magic in the Nano-Tex fabrics is actually the product of a science called nanotechnology, a cutting-edge field that deals with machines, materials, structures, and how they behave at the scale of atoms and molecules, or the nanoscale. By working on this small scale, scientists are able to create enhanced materials with desirable properties, such as stain-resistance. Students should have a basic understanding of science inquiry and of atoms and molecules before beginning this activity. This activity would fit well into any unit about atoms and molecules, the nature of science, or inquiry. If you are interested in an interdisciplinary approach, this activity could also be combined with a social studies class studying advertising or mass communication.
