Granular Materials as a Phase Change Model

Your job is to design a set of experiments that relate granular dynamics to phase change.  With your lab group you must write a problem and hypothesis, define variables, write a procedure, and record data from your tests.  Individually, you should write a finished lab report and a final conclusion. 

All lab groups will have the same materials to conduct your experiment.  You will get a speaker box with moving piston, 2.5mm ball bearings, amplifier/receiver, smartphone with youtube capability.  You are not limited to these materials.  If you have ideas for other items you might use in your experiments, please check with your teacher.

## PROBLEM 
 How can we relate the behavior of ball bearings in our speaker box to ideas of phase change?

## HYPOTHESIS
 If we put ball bearings into the speaker box and turn up the volume then they will behave like a solid, liquid, and gas.

## VARIABLES
Be sure to record as many variables as you can think of.  A variable is something that can change in an experiment.  You may have several for each category.

## CONTROL
 a variable that remains the same throughout experiments   

## MANIPULATED VARIABLE
(independent variable):  a variable that is purposely changed by a scientist throughout a set of experiments


## RESPONDING VARIABLE 
(depending variable):  the outcome that is observed by a scientist that often changes in response to the manipulated variable

Record possible variables here for your set of experiments.
